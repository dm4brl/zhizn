A game without players

"Life" develops strictly according to prescribed rules. It does not require any action on the part of the player - except that it cannot start itself.

Game description

The game is played on a two-dimensional grid. The cells in this grid are either dead or alive. According to the rules, on each turn the cells come to life, die or do not change their status in any way.

Rules of the game

Each step, the game checks where the cells are on the field:

a live cell with two or three neighbors continues to live
a dead cell with three neighbors comes back to life
a live cell dies and a dead cell remains dead if they have more than three or less than two neighbors.
